 # Office Star Choice Model Analysis

## Project Overview

This project was completed as part of my Marketing Analytics course. The objective was to analyze the factors influencing the choice of "Office Star" using a binary logit model. The dataset used for this analysis was [OfficeChoiceData](`/OfficeChoice2.csv`), which includes various attributes like Expensive, Convenient, Service, and Large Choices that could impact the decision.

## Data Description

The dataset includes the following variables:
1. **Choice**: The outcome variable indicating the selection of Office Star.
2. **Expensive**: Indicates if the office is considered expensive.
3. **Convenient**: Measures the convenience of the office.
4. **Service**: Rates the service quality of the office.
5. **LargeChoice**: The variety of large choices available.

## Analysis and Methodology

The analysis was performed using a binary logit model with the following R code:[binary logistic model]("/binary_logistic_reg_OfficeStar.R")

```r
mydata <- read.csv("OfficeChoice2.csv")

# View the first few rows of the data
head(mydata)
summary(mydata)

# Binary logit model
mylogit <- glm(Choice ~ Expensive + Convenient + Service + Largechoice, 
               data = mydata, family = "binomial")

# Model summary
summary(mylogit)

# Odds ratios
exp(coef(mylogit))
```
